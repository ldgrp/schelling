# Schelling Model of Segregation

see: Micromotives and Macrobehaviour

In an $n$ x $m$ grid, each cell is either red, green or white (unoccupied).
An agent is unsatisfied if the ratio of neighbours with the same color
is less than or equal to some threshold. An unsatisfied agent will move
to a more desirable cell.
